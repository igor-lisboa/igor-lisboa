### Hi, I’m Igor!

Since 2017, I am officially working as a Full-Stack Developer (front-end, back-end, dba), but actually I’ve been programming since 2013 in JAVA projects with HTML, CSS and with .NET framework since 2015. Each new technology used in developing new applications or supporting old applications urge me to acquire vastly different skills and tools, thus increasing my technical knowledge.

Skills:
* JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, Node, React, React Native, Vue, Ionic, Python, Java, C#, VB.NET, ASP.NET, PHP, Laravel, Git, PL/SQL, Oracle, MySql, PostgreSQL, MongoDb.

Interests:
* .NET Core, Flutter, GraphQl, Docker.

Specialties:
* JavaScript, PHP, VB.NET, MySql.
