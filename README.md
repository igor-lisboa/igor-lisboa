### Hi, Iâ€™m Igor ðŸ‘‹

When I was a kid, I always looked at my dad's computer and wondered if I would ever understand what each line in programming projects meant. As I grew up, Iâ€™ve learned English (which helped me a lot as most of the forums are written in English) and started helping my father with his company's projects, which was an extremely important experience for my professional growth.

Since 2017, I am officially working as a Full-Stack Developer (front-end, back-end, dba), but actually Iâ€™ve been programming since 2013 in JAVA projects projects with HTML, CSS and with .NET framework since 2015. Each new technology used in developing new applications or supporting old applications urge me to acquire vastly different skills and tools, thus increasing my technical knowledge.

Thought provocative challenges, specially those who force me to evolve both personally and professionally, are the ones that most satisfy me once completed. Where would we be if there wasnâ€™t constant evolution? If a new technology or content is required for a project, Iâ€™ll be the first one up for the challenge. Although young, I am a professional that understands the necessity of constant updates in the field, staying up to date with the latest techs and tools. 

In my bachelorâ€™s degree at Universidade Federal Fluminense, Iâ€™ve used the following programming languages:
- Java.
- Python.
- C.
- Assembly.
- PL/SQL.
