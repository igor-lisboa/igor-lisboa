## Hi, I’m Igor!

* Experienced Software Engineer with a background in developing, scaling, architecting, testing, and maintaining large-scale microservices, and APIs in highly critical environments, serving millions of users daily.
* I consider myself passionate about solving problems and helping people. My main focus is delivering and adding value to the product, despite technicalities and tech preferences. If there’s a problem, there’s a way to solve it, I may not know how to solve all the problems but I will find a way.
* The team and coworkers are very important to me. I came from a background with high-performance teams and I motivate and help the team to beat and surpass the goals from each quarter/sprint.
