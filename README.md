# 👋 Hi, I'm Igor

**Tech Lead and Full-Stack Developer** coding professionally since **2016**.  
I specialize in designing, leading, and scaling mission-critical enterprise systems.  
My background includes modernizing legacy platforms, architecting microservices, and leading engineering teams to deliver cost savings, scalability, and efficiency in high-throughput environments.

⚠️ **Before you scroll through my repos…**  
If you’re here to validate my skills as a developer, you’ll probably be disappointed.  
Most of the code you’ll find here is **“Hello World”-like projects**—just me testing frameworks, languages, or cloud providers.  
The **real, production-grade code** I’ve written lives in **private repositories** of the companies that were smart enough to hire me.

🚀 **Calling all developers!**  
If you’ve stumbled onto my profile and think *“this guy might be crazy enough to build the next big thing”*… you’re right.  
So if you’re interested in teaming up to create the next **$1B company**, drop me a message — let’s make it happen.
